The following are some of the things that I have planned for this system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple distributed system that should be able to run on arbitrary number of machines and be able to do simple operations (like multiplication of matrices).

Each slave machine is served with both the data and the "processor" to work with.
The slave machine has a client running which receives work units from its master and send the master a "message" when its done processing the work unit.

The master schedules the jobs (input by a user e.g.) and does load-balancing among its slaves. When all the work units are complete for a particular job,
the master "reduces" them to the required result.

No failure detection and work unit transfer are to be implemented for now.
